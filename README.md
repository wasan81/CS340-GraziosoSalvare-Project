# GraziosoSalvare-Project

# How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
To make programs easier to maintain, read, and adjust, I focused on creating clear and well-organized code. In Project One, I built a Python module for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. I split each database function into separate, easy-to-understand functions. This makes testing and updating the code simpler. I also used clear function names and added comments to improve understanding. I also handled errors properly and included logging to support debugging. By separating the database logic from the user interface, changes in one area do not affect the other. This design allowed me to reuse the CRUD module in Project Two, which improved efficiency and scalability. In the future, this module can be adapted for building APIs, analyzing data, or integrating with other systems, all with minimal changes.

# How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
When I approach a problem as a computer scientist, I first understand the requirements and break the problem into smaller parts. For the Grazioso Salvare project, I designed a database for dog profiles and created a dashboard for clients to filter and view data. This method differed from my past assignments because it focused on real client needs and emphasized scalability and user-friendliness. In the future, I will use data normalization to organize the database, indexing to improve speed, and testing to ensure the system meets client needs. I will also prioritize clear documentation and modular design for easier updates.
# What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
Computer scientists solve problems using technology by developing algorithms, designing systems, and creating software to manage data efficiently. Their work enhances efficiency across various fields, including business, healthcare, and entertainment, by providing innovative solutions that improve decision-making.
For a company like Grazioso Salvare, designing a database and creating an interactive dashboard would make data more accessible and organized. A structured database would allow quick access to dog profiles, categorize them by breed, age, and proficiency, and track training progress. The dashboard would offer real-time insights, enabling staff to make faster decisions. This system would improve dog training effectiveness, optimize resource management, and ultimately save more lives in rescue operations.
